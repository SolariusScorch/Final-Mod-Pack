  STR_PLASMA_BLADE: "Plasma Blade"
  STR_PLASMA_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This device, essentially an alien combat knife, features a blade sharpened to a monomolecular edge. A magnetic envelope engulfs this blade in a plasma field, giving it the ability to rip through the heat-resistant ceramic inserts in modern body armour."
  STR_PLASMA_SWORD: "Plasma Sword"
  STR_PLASMA_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "This lethal implement of sword combines a large blade, a micron thick at the edge, a plasma emitter, and an electromagnet.

  STR_TANKS_DESTROYED: "SUPPORT UNITS DESTROYED"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY: "Alien Diplomacy"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "It appears that this is not the first time the aliens came upon our world - apparently, before the humans even came to be, a large alien ship crashed on Earth. Now the current invaders are still looking for their disappeared ancestors in hope of reestablishing contact. The aliens are convinced that the ancient crew, or their descendants, are still alive on Earth, though we do not know why. If the two forces ever meet and together turn against us, it will be a dark day for humanity indeed."
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP: "Envoy Ship"
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Envoy Ships are extremely rare on Earth, carrying members of the Ethereal Order to communicate with other star-spanning forces. They have average defenses, but should not be underestimated. Since they usually carry valuable aliens on board, we should attempt to seize them at all costs. They can be easily identified by a hold hue."
  STR_SECTOID_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectoid Guard is an organisation of Sectoid individuals that are separated from normal Sectoid chain of command and trained by the Ethereals themselves. These guardians then are tasked with high-priority missions, like protecting key installations, and are issued body armour for increased protection. They sometimes travel with regular Sectoids as advisors, but otherwise rarely interact with other aliens, except Ethereals. We can expect to see them more when we get near their command structure."
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER: "Ethereal Order"
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Order is the innermost circle of the alien society. Composed solely of Ethereals, this group seems to stand above all specimens we normally encounter on Earth. They also seem to have access to technology that isn't available, or even understandable, to the 'common' aliens. It is unclear whether they are the rulemakers for the aliens or simply an executive organ. Powerful as they may be, they do not take direct part in the invasion effort."
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE: "Photonic Blade"
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This melee weapon uses exotic physics to create a narrow beam of focused photonic energy with limited length. Particles travel from the hilt to the tip of the 'blade' and then inexplicably return, losing very little energy in the process. There seems to be some sort of energy source built into the hilt of the weapon, but we failed to understand its principles of operation and therefore are unable to reproduce this weapon. It is also inconsistent with other artefacts of alien technology."
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER: "Blaster Multi-Launcher"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon seems to be a miniaturized version of the dreaded Blaster Launcher. Its principles of operation are similar, but it uses far more advanced psionic circuitry that seems to exceed the general tech level alien of alien invaders, and we are certainly unable to reproduce it. This psionic circuitry allows for firing multiple missiles almost in rapid succession. Instead of one big chamber for the Blaster Bomb, it has a magazine socket."
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB: "Blaster Multi-Bomb"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "This magazine contains eight high-powered mini-missiles for the Blaster Multi-Launcher. While not as powerful as the Blaster Bomb, these missiles are devastating nonetheless and can be fired rapidly."
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER: "Fire Launcher"
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This cannon-like weapon fires orbs of concentrated energy that explode on impact. Its most significant property is that couldn't find a power source of any kind, nor we could form any coherent theory on how this launcher operates at all. This weapon is far too exotic to be manufactured in our workshops."
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP: "Electro-Whip"
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is essentially similar in function to the Stun Rod, but it doesn't even begin to describe its unusual properties. The whip uses modulated electric impulses to incapacitate the target, but we do not really understand how this modulation works or even where the energy comes from. While we now know how to use this weapon, we are unable to reproduce it."
  STR_CONCUSSION_CANNON: "Concussion Cannon"
  STR_CONCUSSION_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "This ranged weapon uses sonic pulses to incapacitate enemies. While non-lethal, it is extremely effective against living targets. We do not clearly understand how exactly this noise weapon affects living creatures and we have no idea how it is powered, therefore we are unable to copy its design."
  STR_ETHEREAL_SOLDIER_ARMOR: "Ethereal Combat Analysis"

  STR_SYNTHMUSCLE_EXTRACTION: "Synthmuscle Extraction"
  STR_SYNTHMUSCLES_UFOPEDIA: "Synthetic muscles are bionic pseudo-tissue of fantastic properties, acting like normal flesh but much stronger per unit of mass.  They cannot be produced from scratch in reasonable timeframes, but they can be extracted from Muton bodies."

  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Though the laser have been known for decades, alien technology allows for design and use of practical laser weaponry, which is in most ways superior to kinetic weapons."
  STR_GAUSS_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Gauss weapons feature a powerful coil which propels small projectiles using electromagnetic force. Gauss bullets are much faster than traditional bullets, and therefore much more powerful, but also have a rather short range, since they quickly burn up in the atmosphere. Due to the extreme heat produced by Gauss weapons they are incapable of automatic fire."
  STR_RAILGUNS_UFOPEDIA: "The ultimate version of Gauss weaponry, using advanced cooling systems and power management."

  STR_ANTHROPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Anthropods are aggressive creatures probably filling the role of heavy infantry in the alien ranks.  They are strong and also fairly tougher than a human being.  The inefficiency of their respiratory system is evident now that we have a live specimen, oxygen has a toxic effect and eventually kills them within a week.  We believe these creatures are of completely artificial origin, biological robots."
  STR_ANTHROPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Despite its humanoid shape the anatomy of this creature is very alien.  The skeleton is mostly cartilaginous with only few robust bones composing the framework.  The organs have a diffuse quality, all the apparatus are spread within the mass of entrails. The brain size is slightly larger than a human's but it is composed of several ganglions which result in a lower interconnection density.  The respiratory system is rudimentary and inefficient, we also notice signs of inflammation in it."
  STR_SPITTER_UFOPEDIA: "Spitters are creatures with very elementary behavior, they just shoot their disrupting fluid on everything that moves.  The aliens seem to prevent them from attacking the wrong targets using psi powers.  When retracted into their carapaces, they become quite resistant to all matter of damage, especially kinetic.  These creatures are living weapons to be deployed in short range fights."
  STR_SPITTER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The torso of this creature holds a massive gland that secretes high amounts of disrupting enzyme.  The enzyme is then stored in a chamber at the base of the funnels, presumably where high pressure quickly builds up to ultimately eject the substance on the target. The enzyme is a highly complex polymer capable of disintegrating any material almost instantly.  We currently can't synthesize it. It also has a very resistant carapace."

  STR_GAZER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The single big eye is the most prominent anatomical feature of this alien; it has crustacean traits but it is much more evolved. The very thick armour is not simply worn; cybernetic implants stem from it and connect to the organs of the creature, it is a shell for the creature."
  STR_HOLODRONE_UFOPEDIA: "Holodrones are living, floating, artillery weapons. They are protected by plasma a bubble that interferes with plasma attacks and fire. It could be that they were developed specifically to fight plasma-equipped enemies. The mechanism runs too hot and radioactive to be applied to a human armor."
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A very complex automaton powered by a massive, for its size, Elerium core.

  STR_WASPITE_UFOPEDIA: "Waspites are elite terror agents and combatants. They are very aggressive, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced, making them fearsome enemies. Their overall frailty though hints to an artillery role, rather than infantry. The spiral device that replaces their original bodies generates an anti-gravity field, enabling them to float through the air."
  STR_WASPITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The anatomy of this creature verges on insanity. The body consists of a spiral life support system, combined with a symbiotic, bioengineered plant. Grafted on to the body, are a pair of mechanical arms and the insect-like head of the creature, which is presumably the only piece left of the original species. The plant portion of the body is vulnerable to fire."
  STR_CYBERMITE_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature robot is an automated terror weapon and represents the pinnacle of the alien robotics. As soon as the powerful optical sensor spots a target, the creature runs to it and attacks. The miniaturized Elerium core is set to ignite and explode once damaged enough, making the act of killing the creature deadly for anyone nearby."
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most prominent feature of this incredibly complex robot is its weapon, an alloy sting linked to a miniaturized tank which, from the traces found, is presumably filled with a potent toxin.

Moreover, certain fragments seem to have been added artificially, probably extracted from Earth organisms.
