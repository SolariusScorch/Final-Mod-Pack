  STR_TANKS_DESTROYED: "SUPPORT UNITS DESTROYED"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY: "Alien Diplomacy"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "It appears that this is not the first time the aliens came upon our world - apparently, before the humans even came to be, a large alien ship crashed on Earth. Now the current invaders are still looking for their lost ancestors in hope of reestablishing contact. The aliens are convinced that the ancient crew, or their descendants, are still alive on Earth, though we do not know why. If the two forces ever meet and together turn against us, it will be a dark day for humanity indeed."
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP: "Envoy Ship"
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Envoy Ships are extremely rare on Earth, carrying members of the Ethereal Order to communicate with other star-spanning forces. They have average defenses, but should not be underestimated. Since they usually carry valuable aliens on board, we should attempt to seize them at all costs. They can be easily identified by a gold hue."
  STR_SECTOID_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectoid Guard is an organisation of Sectoid individuals that are separated from normal Sectoid chain of command and trained by the Ethereals themselves. These guardians then are tasked with high-priority missions, like protecting key installations, and are issued body armor for increased protection. They sometimes travel with regular Sectoids as advisors, but otherwise rarely interact with other aliens, except Ethereals. We can expect to see them more when we get near the aliens' command structure."
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER: "Ethereal Order"
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Order is the innermost circle of the alien society. Composed solely of Ethereals, this group seems to stand above all specimens we normally encounter on Earth. They also seem to have access to technology that isn't available, or even understandable, to the 'common' aliens. It is unclear whether they are the rulemakers for the aliens or simply an executive organ. Powerful as they may be, they do not take direct part in the invasion effort."
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE: "Photonic Blade"
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This melee weapon uses exotic physics to create a narrow beam of focused photonic energy with limited length. Particles travel from the hilt to the tip of the 'blade' and then inexplicably return, losing very little energy in the process. There seems to be some sort of energy source built into the hilt of the weapon, but we failed to understand its principles of operation and therefore are unable to reproduce this weapon. It is also inconsistent with other artifacts of alien technology."
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER: "Blaster Multi-Launcher"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon seems to be a miniaturized version of the dreaded Blaster Launcher. Its principles of operation are similar, but it uses far more advanced psionic circuitry that seems to exceed the general tech level alien of alien invaders, and we are certainly unable to reproduce it. This psionic circuitry allows for firing multiple missiles almost in rapid succession. Instead of one big chamber for the Blaster Bomb, it has a magazine socket."
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB: "Blaster Multi-Bomb"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "This magazine contains eight high-powered mini-missiles for the Blaster Multi-Launcher. While not as powerful as the Blaster Bomb, these missiles are devastating nonetheless and can be fired rapidly."
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER: "Fire Launcher"
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This cannon-like weapon fires orbs of concentrated energy that explode on impact. Its most significant property is that we couldn't find a power source of any kind, nor we could form any coherent theory on how this launcher operates at all. This weapon is far too exotic to be manufactured in our workshops."
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP: "Electro-Whip"
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is essentially similar in function to the Stun Rod, but that doesn't even begin to describe its unusual properties. The whip uses modulated electric impulses to incapacitate the target, but we do not really understand how this modulation works or even where the energy comes from. While we now know how to use this weapon, we are unable to reproduce it."
  STR_CONCUSSION_CANNON: "Concussion Cannon"
  STR_CONCUSSION_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "This ranged weapon uses sonic pulses to incapacitate enemies. While non-lethal, it is extremely effective against living targets. We do not clearly understand how exactly this noise weapon affects living creatures and we have no idea how it is powered, therefore we are unable to copy its design."
  STR_ETHEREAL_SOLDIER_ARMOR: "Ethereal Combat Analysis"
  STR_ETHEREAL_WHITE_CORPSE: "Ethereal Corpse"

  STR_MIB_TERROR_MISSION_BRIEFING: "The Men in Black are cleansing a whole settlement to get rid of witnesses. Mission will be successful when all enemy units have been eliminated or neutralized. You must attempt to save the lives of any civilians in the area by stopping the rogue group by any means necessary. To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to transport vehicle and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."

  STR_OPTRONICS: "Optronics"
  STR_OPTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "Optronics are enhanced electronics using light rather than electrons to carry the information, and therefore much much faster and more power-efficient."
  STR_SYNTHETIC_MUSCLES: "Synthetic Muscles"
  STR_SYNTHMUSCLES: "Synthmuscles"
  STR_SYNTHMUSCLE_EXTRACTION: "Synthmuscle Extraction"
  STR_SYNTHMUSCLES_UFOPEDIA: "Synthetic muscles are bionic pseudo-tissue of fantastic properties, acting like normal flesh but much stronger per unit of mass. They cannot be produced from scratch in reasonable timeframes, but they can be extracted from Muton bodies."

  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Though the laser have been known for decades, alien technology allows for design and use of practical laser weaponry, which is in most ways superior to kinetic weapons."
  STR_GAUSS_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Gauss weapons feature a powerful coil which propels small projectiles using electromagnetic force. Gauss bullets are much faster than traditional bullets, and therefore much more powerful, but also have a rather short range, since they quickly burn up in the atmosphere. Due to the extreme heat produced by Gauss weapons they are incapable of automatic fire."
  STR_RAILGUNS_UFOPEDIA: "The ultimate version of Gauss weaponry, using advanced cooling systems and power management."
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_RIFLE: "Alien Laser Rifle"
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_RIFLE_CLIP: "Alien Laser Rifle Clip"

  STR_ANTHROPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Anthropods are aggressive creatures probably filling the role of heavy infantry in the alien ranks. They are strong and also fairly tougher than a human being. The inefficiency of their respiratory system is evident now that we have a live specimen, oxygen has a toxic effect and eventually kills them within a week. We believe these creatures are of completely artificial origin, being biological robots."
  STR_ANTHROPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Despite its humanoid shape the anatomy of this creature is very alien. The skeleton is mostly cartilaginous with only few robust bones composing the framework. The organs have a diffuse quality, all the apparatus are spread within the mass of entrails. The brain size is slightly larger than a human's but it is composed of several ganglions which result in a lower interconnection density. The respiratory system is rudimentary and inefficient, we also notice signs of inflammation in it."
  STR_SPITTER_UFOPEDIA: "Spitters are creatures with very elementary behavior, they just shoot their disrupting fluid on everything that moves. The aliens seem to prevent them from attacking the wrong targets using psi powers. When retracted into their carapaces, they become quite resistant to all matter of damage, especially kinetic. These creatures are living weapons to be deployed in short range fights."
  STR_SPITTER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The torso of this creature holds a massive gland that secretes high amounts of disrupting enzyme. The enzyme is then stored in a chamber at the base of the funnels, presumably where high pressure quickly builds up to ultimately eject the substance on the target. The enzyme is a highly complex polymer capable of disintegrating any material almost instantly. We currently can't synthesize it. It also has a very resistant carapace."

  STR_CEREBREAL_UFOPEDIA: "Cerebreals are a race that is not fully integrated into the alien hive-like society; they are more like allies, who agreed to serve the invaders for some unfathomable reasons. They wield incredibly strong psionic powers, which can be focused as a weapon: a violent discharge of plasma, fuelled by will alone. Their independent and completely alien pattern of thinking make them unpredictable, but also more prone to panic than other alien races."
  STR_CEREBREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This specimen is not your typical alien race: its genetics are completely different to both Earth and most alien species, and it seems even stranger than most other types of alien life. Most of its body mass is neural matter, and the rest is almost exclusively advanced cybernetics to keep this enormous 'brain' running. It seems unable to use hand weapons, and it has no significant natural means of defense. There is little else we can say about this terrifying creature."
  STR_CEREBREAL_LARVA_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is a young form of a Cerebreal, encased in a tiny UFO-like vehicle for protection on the battlefield.

It is quite resistant to bullets, but can be stopped with fire or explosions. Its short tail provides a counterbalance, useful for sprinting."
  STR_CHASER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is actually a cyborg with sturdy robotic legs. The body is protected by a fine layer of mail, but the biological tissues are pretty vulnerable to damage.

Their intelligence is average, but they are more than capable of waging a war against mankind."
  STR_CHTONITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This alien has a strong and resilient body, but is otherwise quite similar to us. Its thick skin gives it good protection against bullets and blades alike.

  STR_GAZER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The single big eye is the most prominent anatomical feature of this alien; it has crustacean traits but it is much more evolved. The very thick armor is not simply worn; cybernetic implants stem from it and connect to the organs of the creature, it is a shell for the creature."
  STR_HOLODRONE_UFOPEDIA: "Holodrones are living, floating, artillery weapons. They are protected by a plasma bubble that interferes with plasma attacks and fire. It could be that they were developed specifically to fight plasma-equipped enemies. The mechanism runs too hot and radioactive to be applied to human armor."
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A very complex automaton powered by a massive, for its size, Elerium core.

  STR_WASPITE_UFOPEDIA: "Waspites are elite terror agents and combatants. They are very aggressive, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced, making them fearsome enemies. Their overall frailty though hints to an artillery role, rather than infantry. The spiral device that replaces their original bodies generates an anti-gravity field, enabling them to float through the air."
  STR_WASPITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The anatomy of this creature verges on insanity. The body consists of a spiral life support system, combined with a symbiotic, bioengineered plant. Grafted on to the body, are a pair of mechanical arms and the insect-like head of the creature, which is presumably the only piece left of the original species. The plant portion of the body is vulnerable to fire."
  STR_CYBERMITE_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature robot is an automated terror weapon and represents the pinnacle of the alien robotics. As soon as the powerful optical sensor spots a target, the creature runs to it and attacks. The miniaturized Elerium core is set to ignite and explode once damaged enough, making the act of killing the creature deadly for anyone nearby."
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most prominent feature of this incredibly complex robot is its weapon, an alloy sting linked to a miniaturized tank which, from the traces found, is presumably filled with a potent toxin. The power core is too damaged to be fully understood but it seems to be designed to be very susceptible to damage and it is likely this will cause it to explode."

Despite their bestial appearance, they possess extraordinary intelligence, which makes them excellent spies and field agents. There is not much we can say about their origins, but their long history on Earth and their genetic closeness to ourselves point to a terrestrial genesis. Nonetheless, their loyalty to aliens is absolute."
  STR_REPTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is covered with tough scales, able to withstand small caliber bullets with ease. Curiously, despite its reptilian appearance, it seems to be quite resistant to heat. The brain is highly developed, suggesting a possible superhuman intelligence. Its most interesting feature however is the DNA, which is either terrestrial in origin or modelled after Earth creatures."
  STR_SALAMANDRON_UFOPEDIA: "The Salamandron is a frightening beast, vaguely resembling ancient predators but also quite different. Designed solely for terror, it is equipped with incendiary rockets, able to lay waste to a small town within minutes. Its behavior can be regulated by a set of small receivers implanted into its brain, but it largely operates on its own, making it difficult to control but also virtually invulnerable to jamming."
  STR_SALAMANDRON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is very sturdy, covered with thick scales and extremely resistant to heat, but not so much to laser cutters.

  STR_ALIEN_OPTICAL_PROCESSOR: "Alien Optical Processor"
  STR_ALIEN_GARDENS: "Alien Gardens"
  STR_POWER_SOURCE_MINIATURIZATION_UFOPEDIA: "By careful examination of the UFO Power Source, we have developed the technology of storing vast quantities of energy using Elerium cells. This advanced battery greatly exceeds any other portable power source previously developed."
  STR_ALIEN_BIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Our preliminary research show that aliens have DNA much like ours, but so different that we should assume it has extraterrestrial origins - or at least coming from some inconceivable depths of time. Moreover, certain fragments seem to have been added artificially, probably extracted from Earth organisms. This likely helps the aliens to adapt to our environment, but it is either short-term or incomplete: dependant on pre-processed nutrients and with poor immunology, aliens can't survive on Earth for long, therefore special arrangements must be made to study a living specimen."
  STR_ADVANCED_PLASMA_PHYSICS_UFOPEDIA: "While plasma has been known to human science for decades, it remained highly unpredictable and difficult to produce in a controlled environment. The alien science seems to have overcome these obstacles centuries ago, thanks to some dedicated mathematical equations and technological advancements derived from them. With time, we will be able to understand and copy this equipment for our own energy needs."
  STR_TRACTOR_BEAM_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This large-scale device is used in Alien Bases to assist large UFOs with precise landing. It employs artificial gravity to decrease and otherwise manipulate mass of large objects up to 400 meters away. It is, however, far too bulky to be mounted on any flying craft, even the largest UFOs, and therefore provides no advantage to our troops."
  STR_ALIEN_GRAVITY_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Alien Gravity Generator is in fact a graviton emitter, which can amplify, nullify or modulate gravity fields on small scales. While it has no direct combat application, it is sure to be a great boon to human space exploration, atmospheric flight and many fields of engineering."
  STR_FUSION_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA: "While the Elerium element in itself is extremely efficient at releasing large amounts of energy at once, it can also be used to initiate a fusion reaction. While not as efficient, a fusion blast is far cheaper and easier to create. Combined in the right proportion with a highly energetic crystalline material, this allows for violent discharges of energy, emitting large amounts of heat but very little radiation. This discovery can potentially revolutionize human warfare against the aliens."
  STR_PARTICLE_MICROACCELERATION_UFOPEDIA: "Many alien designs, including plasma weapons, feature a particle acceleration chamber. Based on gravity modulation, this component accelerates small lumps of matter to whirl at great velocities, creating enough heat to produce plasma. This process is very fast, therefore it requires E-115 to provide the necessary amount of energy."
  STR_ANTIMATTER_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Anti-matter is an excellent source of energy, but this also makes it extremely unstable. The aliens have overcome this problem by a clever application of gravity fields, separating the anti-matter from normal matter and thus preventing them from reacting with each other, as long as the field is in place. This discovery is likely to bring great advancement to the human civilization, and certainly can be used against the alien threat."
  STR_DELTA_RADIATION_UFOPEDIA: "Delta rays are completely different from any other sort of radiation known to humanity, as they are shifted out into something that can only be described as 'hyperspace'. These rays generally do not interact with ordinary matter or energy, so they are harmless to humans and impossible to detect with ordinary equipment. They do, however, react with the Elerium element, exciting its atoms and destabilizing their structure, therefore allowing for quick conversion from matter to energy. Unfortunately, the right frequency to provoke this reaction makes their range extremely short, which prevents us from disrupting alien weaponry on the battlefield."
  STR_ALIEN_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of integrated microprocessors, the aliens use specially grown crystal matrices to create logic machines. While not inherently faster, these crystals allow for a multi-threaded communication between its nodes, therefore achieving and even surpassing the level of the theoretical quantum computer. Now we have the rough understanding on how these alien 'electronics' work and even how to program them, but sadly we do not possess the technology to make them from scratch - we need to rely on whatever we can gather on the battlefield."
  STR_ALIEN_NEUROPSYCHOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "While there are many types of alien life forms, they do share certain neuropsychological features that are either inherent to their species or artificially inserted. These features allow the aliens to cooperate in a hive-like manner, despite biological differences. These common patterns are mostly related to non-verbal communication, internal visualization and transmission of simple emotions. Now we can expect to be able to tap into their interpersonal communication channels and possibly use it to our advantage."
  STR_ALIEN_SUBJUGATION_UFOPEDIA: "While humans use electrical impulses to cause a neural system to overload, the aliens have developed a much more efficient and safer method, based on gravitic distortion. A gravity wave of a fine-tuned frequency disrupts higher brain functions within a fraction of a second, while leaving other bodily functions unharmed. This method is extremely effective in temporarily disabling humans, be it on the battlefield or in alien surgery rooms."
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Plasma weapons are very powerful tools of war, based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field."
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Fusion weapons use Elerium-based explosives to create powerful blasts of pure energy."
  STR_ALIEN_CODES_UFOPEDIA: "For interplanetary communication, the aliens use special equipment that seems to be able to emit waves which travel faster than the speed of light. These waves are modulated to encode messages with a complex, yet logical pattern. This pattern is now understood by us, which gives us hope of attaining the possibility of intercepting and decoding alien communications."
  STR_ALIEN_OPTICAL_PROCESSOR_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens use a special device to communicate with their navigation equipment. This device emits carefully modulated flashes of bright light directly into the eyes of the operator, stimulating their brain and therefore feeding them with information. It is unclear how this device receives feedback from the pilot, but it seems to read and analyze their brain wave patterns, which are then processed and fed into the UFO Navigation."
  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien technology routinely uses incredibly advanced components that store, release and transmit high energies easily, safely and with minimal losses. Although completely different in design from our own equipment, and using unusual materials, they can now be copied relatively easily by our engineers and used for a variety of applications."
  STR_ALIEN_GARDENS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien Bases contain special facilities for cultivation of genetically engineered plant-like life forms. Despite their name, these 'gardens' play little part in alien food production; instead they produce various biochemicals used in alien industry and warfare."
  STR_ALLOY_AMMO: "Alien Alloy Ammunition"
  STR_ALLOY_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Recent advances in material science - brought about by studying the Alien Alloys - have enabled us to construct a fearsome craft weapon, much more powerful than the previous cannon."
  STR_ALLOY_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "With the knowledge of how to process the ultra-strong yet lightweight alien alloys, we can now manufacture alloy bullets capable of withstanding higher muzzle velocities without disintegrating, fired from alloy casings that are lighter yet stronger than previously possible."
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION: "Fusion Weapons Calibration"
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien fusion weapons are extremely potent, but they must be recalibrated daily to stay usable. Since we have learned how to do so, we can employ such alien weapons from now on, provided that we manage to secure them on the battlefield."
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION: "Plasma Weapons Calibration"

Even the strongest armor plates and UFO hulls are no match for this device.{NEWLINE}However, it is only effective at close range and needs a separate power cell."
  STR_FUSION_TORCH_POWER_CELL_UFOPEDIA: "This high energy power cell is needed to operate the Fusion Torch. It provides enough energy for 5 plasma jets."
  STR_ELERIUM_MACE: "Power Mace"
  STR_ELERIUM_MACE_UFOPEDIA: "Using Elerium-115 as fuel, this power weapon discharges a powerful electrical pulse to its unfortunate victim. A successful strike will overload the nervous system of the target, effectively incapacitating it. The Power Mace will stun organic beings."
